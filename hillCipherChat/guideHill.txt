
📡 Local Messaging with Hill Cipher (Same Network) from different computers at home!

🧰 What You’ll Need:
- Two computers connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- Postman installed on both (or any tool that can send POST requests).
- One person (the host) running the Flask encryption server.

👣 Step-by-Step Instructions

✅ 1. Start the Flask Server (Host)
On one computer (the host):
- Run the Python script that contains the Flask app.
- Make sure it's running and says something like:
  Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000

📍 2. Find the Host’s Local IP Address
On the host computer, open Command Prompt and type:
    ipconfig
Look for a line under your Wi-Fi Adapter that says something like:
    IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.x.x
That 192.168.x.x is the host’s local IP address. Keep this handy!

💌 3. Send an Encrypted Message Using Postman
(Sadly you need a Postman account for this to work but it is easy!)
On any computer on the same network:
1. Open Postman.
2. Set method to **POST**.
3. Set the request URL to:
       http://<host-local-ip>:5000/encrypt
   Replace <host-local-ip> with the actual IP, e.g., 192.168.1.25
4. Click the **Body** tab.
5. Select **raw** and change the format to **JSON**.
6. Enter the following JSON:
       {
         "message": "HELLO FRIEND"
       }
7. Click **Send**.
8. The response will show:
       {
         "encrypted_message": "ENCRYPTEDMESSAGE"
       }

🔓 4. Decrypt a Message Using Postman
(Sadly you need a Postman account for this to work)
On the receiver’s computer:
1. Copy the encrypted message from the sender.
2. Open Postman.
3. Set method to **POST**.
4. Set the request URL to:
       http://<host-local-ip>:5000/decrypt
5. In the **Body** tab, choose **raw** and set to **JSON**.
6. Enter:
       {
         "ciphertext": "ENCRYPTEDMESSAGE"
       }
7. Click **Send**.
8. The response will show:
       {
         "decrypted_message": "HELLO FRIEND"
       }

🌐 5. View the Message History
On any browser, go to:
       http://<host-local-ip>:5000/messages
You’ll see all encrypted and decrypted messages listed with full matrix details!

💡 Tips
- Make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi.
- The site doesn’t update right away, wait a few seconds and refresh the page manually.
- No need to send or install code on other machines — only the host runs the server!
